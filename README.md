# Text Generation App

<!-- dash-content-start -->

Generate text based on text prompts using [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/).

In this example, going to the website will generate text from your prompt query parameter using the `@cf/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b` model.

Be patient! Your text may take a few seconds to generate.
